# Meetapp Mobile | Bootcamp GoStack Module 10 Challenge
In this challenge, I will build the mobile of the Meetapp application with React Native by using the API developed in this repository (<a href="https://github.com/AugustoMarcelo/meetapp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meetup Backend</a>).

The application will be created from scratch by using React Native CLI and setting code patters tools like Reactotron, Redux and Redux Saga.

This application will be used by meetup subscribers and will not have meetup organization features.
